My personal portfolio
In this portfolio, I use flexbox quite allot to space out my content.
There's a brief home header, an about header, projects header, and a contact me header.
The links at the left of the navigation bar doesn't go anywhere, but my github and linkedin are actually attached to the links at the right.
The logo in the middle is a cartoon drawing of me during covid I paid my friend to do.
The pictures are a picture of me in a different bootcamp and a picture of my mom, dad and I post high school graduation, respectively.
I knew how to make a form prior to joining this bootcamp, hence the formulated inputs in the contact me section.
I used to have projects in my github that I wanted to actually showcase, but I thought that they were outdated and rather use updated projects so I can come back and link them here instead with a screenshot of actual written code in the div box containing the project.
My goal is to have more professional photos for me to use for this website, actual projects that I can link to, and make my form functioning so that people can send thier information to me easier.
