My personal portfolio
I'm a semi-expereinced web developer. 
I've had the pleasure of working on many projects through high school and early college, ranging from working on the Watson AI in IBM to working in a small group of young programmers and programming in Bootstrap briefly at ETSY. 
It is my passion to code and work in collaborative settings; being able to create and build with other programmers, while stressful at times, brings me much joy, I do not need motivation to code. 
Being a young black male from Brooklyn, there arent't much opportunities to elevate yourself and gain not only experience but connections in this field.
In college, I only wanted to code and expand in my skills, so having to do electives and learn about other topics didn't resonate well with me.
Now at 24, my only wish is to get my foot through the door with an opportunity to grow into being a full stack developer.
